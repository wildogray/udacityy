  				<li><span>Average Lifespan</span>: unknown</li>
  				<li><span>Habitat</span>: Dolphins are found living in bodies of water around the world. They inhabit all of the oceans and some important rivers. Most of them live in saltwater, but a few species thrive in freshwater. The habitat of dolphins varies according to environmental factors and food accessibility.</li>
  			</ul>
  			<p>Dolphins are small-toothed cetaceans easily recognizable by their curved mouths, which give them a permanent “smile.” There are 36 dolphin species, found in every ocean. Most dolphins are marine and live in the ocean or brackish waters along coastlines. There are a few species, however, like the South Asian river dolphin and the Amazon river dolphin, or boto, that live in freshwater streams and rivers.</p>
